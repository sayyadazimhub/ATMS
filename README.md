1. **New admin:** Go to **Get Started** or `/register` and create an admin account (name, email, password). Existing admins can register additional admins the same way.
2. **Login:** Go to `/login` and sign in with your admin credentials.
3. Use **Products**, **Providers**, **Customers** to add master data, then **Purchases** and **Sales** for transactions. Use **Reports** and **Settings** as needed.

### For Users (multiple users)

1. Go to `/login` and sign in with your user credentials.
2. **Dashboard** – Check totals, low-stock items, and recent sales/purchases.
3. **Products** – Add/edit products and units.
4. **Providers** – Manage supplier/farmer contacts.
5. **Customers** – Manage buyer contacts.
6. **Purchases** – Record purchases; stock increases automatically.
7. **Sales** – Record sales; stock is validated and reduced; profit is calculated.
8. **Reports** – Pick date range or period (Daily/Monthly/Yearly) and view profit/loss.
9. Forgot password: use **Forgot password?** on the login page and follow the reset flow.
